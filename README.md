# vagrant-rsync-pick

The plugin allows you to pick atomic changes from the guest machine folder via rsync.

The `rsync` shared folder type is much faster (10x times maybe)
than nfs/virtualbox/smb and others.

But it has one huge disadvantage: it isn't possible to sync data
in a bidirectional way at all. So when you generate a new migration
or rake task for example your changes are kept on your guest machine only.

## Installation

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-rsync-pick

And then configure your guest directory (where the files are taken from)
and your host directory (where the files are stored to):

```ruby
  config.rsync_pick.guest_dir = "/var/www/my-app"
  config.rsync_pick.host_dir = Dir.pwd
```

## Usage

Execute this command so the file(s) is(are) rsynced to you host folder:

    $ vagrant rpick db/migrate/20100825634193_create_table.rb
